                        At the front of the classroom I have a locked cage. Inside the cage is a Kodiak Grizzly Bear. In
                        just a moment I will unlock the cage. I have already locked all the doors and windows of this
                        classroom. What’s that? No, <i>next </i>week we are going to learn about flight.

                        Can I get a suggestion for a class to teach. I heard “History of the Ancient Near East: The
                        Levant (up to Alexander the Great).” This class will explore The civilization and cultural
                        traditions of the peoples of Syria-Palestine from the third millennium to the time of Alexander
                        the Great.
